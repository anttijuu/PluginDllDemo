     An interface class for all cryptographic implementations.
     Using the Curiously Recursive Template Pattern (CRTP) to go around the fact
     that static functions in interface class cannot be overridden by subclasses. I want
     the method() function to be static so that you can query the name of the method
     without instantiating the subclasses of EasyCryptoPriv. See the declaration of the
     subclasses EasyCryptoPrivReverse and EasyCryptoPrivMatrix as well as how to use them
     in EasyCryptoLib API class. For more information, see e.g.
