/**
 This class is the public interface to the crypting library. The library
 supports multiple encrypting methods and also decrypts the encrypted text back
 to plain text.<br />
 All the methods in this class are static, so there is no need to instantiate the class.
 Implementation creates necessary internal objects which do the actual encrypting
 and decrypting.<br />
 Build the code in the library as a dynamic library. In Mac OS X, they are called .dylib's
 and in Linux, shared libraries (.so). In Windows, they are DLLs. For client app development,
 provide this header file, with the library binary file (.dylib, .so or .dll) file, and nothing more.
 Client app developers use these two files when using the functionality of the library.
