EasyCryptoLib
Version 1.0

The source code here implements a dynamic library called EasyCryptoLib,
which is capable of encrypting and decrypting text using several methods
of cryption. Methods supported in the current version are "reverse" and 
"matrix".

The library is implemented using C++11 and utilises the Standard
Template Library.

The library is tested to work on Ubuntu as well as Mac OS X 10.11.

The included makefile can be used to build the library using g++.

It is relatively easy to create an XCode Project for the library,
using command File > New > Project > OSX Framework & Library > Library
and add the files to the project.

The interface to the EasyCryptoLib consists of two files:

* EasyCryptoLib.hpp, the header file used by client apps
* EasyCrytoLib.dylib/.so/.dll, a shared (dynamic) library clients use at runtime

Assumption is that after building, the interface consisting of these two files
is copied to a shared include and library directory in the system and used
from there by the client applications.

In Ubuntu and Mac, the directory for the shared hpp file is /usr/local/include,
and the directory for the shared library file is /usr/local/lib.

You can build the library and install it using the provided makefile, using the
following commands

make
sudo make install

The first command builds the library, and if the build succeeds, the second
command installs the header files to the shared directories as described above.

NOTE: The version provided here also installs, for demonstration purposes,
a file EasyCryptoLibBad.hpp and code for this interface class is also included
in the shared library file. Please remove this interface class before
seriously using the library, and rebuild and install the public interface using
the  commands as described above.

Please see the provided LICENSE file for copyright.
